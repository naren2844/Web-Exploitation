	   <h2>WEB EXPLOITATION</h2>
     <br>
<p>
	Websites are significantly more complex today than in the early 1990s when they mostly served static HTML content. Web applications often serve dynamic content, use databases, and rely on third-party web services.The application server itself is being built from many components, which may come from diverse sources. Servers authenticate users before logging them into the system. They also authorize users to access restricted resources or data. Often applications handle sensitive user data that need to be protected.<br>
  Given this complexity, it's not easy to deploy and maintain web applications in a secure way. No application is perfect. Hackers are always on the lookout to discover and exploit vulnerabilities.

      <h3>TERM WEB EXPLOITATION</h3>
      <br>
<p>Websites all around the world are programmed using various programming languages. While there are specific vulnerabilities in each programming langage that the developer should be aware of, there are issues fundamental to the internet that can show up regardless of the chosen language or framework.

	   <h4>ASPECTS OF AN APPLICATION ARE VULNERABLE</h4>
      <br>
<p>A web application typically involves a web server, an application server, application middleware, internal or third-party web services, a database, and so on. Any of these components could be attacked.
<br>
An attack could be as simple as slowing down the server by making lots of HTTP requests. More serious attacks would involve installing a virus on the server or stealing sensitive data. Defacing the site by modifying site content, or deleting code or data are just as serious but more easily visible. Another attack is to run cryptocurrency miners on server infrastructure.
<br>
Web clients/browsers and servers communicate via protocols such as HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, etc. Vulnerabilities in how these protocols are used could be exploited. Protocols are located at different layers of the protocol stack. Although web exploits happen at the application layer (layer 7), it can impact other layers via packet flooding (data link layer) or SYN flooding (network layer). However, web exploits at the application layer are becoming more common than network layer attacks on web servers.
